#Create two classes, one is the Aggregator and the other is the Collaborator

# Aggregator: Initialize the model, send the model to the collaborators (there are 30 collaborators), then every 
# Collaborator will update the model with the initial weights of the Collaborator, 
# finally the aggregator will extract the weights 
# of the Collaborators and update the model with the mean of the weights. This is repeated for some epochs.

# Collaborator: Do one step of SGD with the data of one user and then send the updated model to the aggregator
